{"name":"Bus coverage heatmap","tagline":"Hackathon project for visualizing the bus stop coverage in the UK using OpenData","body":"## Author\r\n[Manuel Martin Salvador](http://draxus.org) is currently a researcher in Machine Learning working at Bournemouth University.\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThis project was made during <a href=\"http://hackbmth.org/events/civic-hackday-transport-part-two/\">civic hackday</a> on 7th Feb 2015 organized by <a href=\"http://hackbmth.org\">Hackbmth</a>.\r\n\r\nDuring the search of accommodation, many factors are taken into account like price, nearby facilities, etc. Another aspect to consider by many people is the distance to a bus stop in case they need to travel often to work. There is currently not available way of visualizing such information easily in a map in the UK. That is the motivation for developing this project.\r\n\r\nA similar poject was made <a href=\"http://thejeshgn.com/2013/11/29/bmtc-bus-stop-accessibility/\">in Bangalore</a>, where a heatmap is used for showing what areas are covered by a bus stop. I have developed a similar implentation using the bus stops in Bournemouth with the <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/naptan\">data released by the UK government</a>.\r\n\r\nHowever, such maps only take into account the aerial distance which is only realistic if we have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro\">autogyro</a> (in which case we wouldn't travel by bus :)). An alternative map showing the real walking distance to the bus stops is required. The method I have developed creates a grid around the bus stop and calculate the walking distance from each point in the grid to the bus stop using <a href=\"http://www.routino.org/\">routino</a> (a router for OpenStreetMap). Then, such data is visualized using a heatmap. Nevertheless, the representation can still be improved. During the developing of this project I found that <a href=\"https://developers.route360.net/\">Route360</a> is actually working on the same thing but currently is only available for Berlin.\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\nSource code and data used in this project is realeased under Public Domain in Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/DraXus/bus-coverage-heatmap\">https://github.com/DraXus/bus-coverage-heatmap</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Powered by\r\n<a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">![OpenStreetMap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DraXus/bus-coverage-heatmap/master/img/osm.png)</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://leafletjs.com\">![Leaflet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DraXus/bus-coverage-heatmap/master/img/leaflet.png)</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://bournemouthdata.io/\">![Bournemouth Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DraXus/bus-coverage-heatmap/master/img/bournemouthdata.png)</a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
