<p>This project was made during <a href="http://hackbmth.org/events/civic-hackday-transport-part-two/">civic hackday</a> on 7th Feb 2015 organized by <a href="http://hackbmth.org">Hackbmth</a>.</p>

<p>During the search of accommodation, many factors are taken into account like price, nearby facilities, etc. Another aspect to consider by many people is the distance to a bus stop in case they need to travel often to work. There is currently not available way of visualizing such information easily in a map in the UK. That is the motivation for developing this project.</p>

<p>A similar poject was made <a href="http://thejeshgn.com/2013/11/29/bmtc-bus-stop-accessibility/">in Bangalore</a>, where a heatmap is used for showing what areas are covered by a bus stop. I have developed a similar implentation using the bus stops in Bournemouth with the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/naptan">data released by the UK government</a>.</p>

<p>However, such maps only take into account the aerial distance which is only realistic if we have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro">autogyro</a> (in which case we wouldn't travel by bus :)). An alternative map showing the real walking distance to the bus stops is required. The method I have developed creates a grid around the bus stop and calculate the walking distance from each point in the grid to the bus stop using <a href="http://www.routino.org/">routino</a> (a router for OpenStreetMap). Then, such data is visualized using a heatmap. Nevertheless, the representation can still be improved. During the developing of this project I found that <a href="https://developers.route360.net/">Route360</a> is actually working on the same thing but currently is only available for Berlin.</p>
